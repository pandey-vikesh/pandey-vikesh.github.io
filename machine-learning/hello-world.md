2. Install scikit-learn library. For downloading and installation, follow the steps mentioned [here](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)
3. create a python file `hello_world.py`.
4. Now, add the very first line of code in `hello_world.py` which is to import scikit-learn. This would also validate if scikit-learn has been installed and configured correctly or not. Following is how content of file `hello_world.py` should look like now:
````
import sklearn
````
5. Run this program on the terminal or from any IDE of your choice. If the program executes successfully, it means scikit-learn's installation and import has been successful.
