### Case study in ML - Iris flower data-set.

Today, we are going to talk about the implementation of machine-learning to solve a classic problem in data science, 
which is, [iris flower data-set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set). This is one of the first and 
basic case studies machine-learning enthusiasts encounter while working on machine learning. 

The aim of this case study is to see if a program can predict the type of flower correctly if it has been trained on 
similar data of flowers. 


For this, we would take the iris data set from this [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set).
The data set includes three different types of flowers. They are all species of iris named as `setosa`, `versicolor` and
 `virginica`. Below a sample screenshot of how the data looks like:
 
 ![iris_flower_data_set]({{ site.url }}/assets/machine-learning/iris_flower_data_set.png)
 
 In the data set, we are given 50 examples of each type of flower. Each flower is defined by four features 
which are `sepal length`, `sepal width`, `petal length` and `petal width`. Hence, the first four columns give the `features`
and the last column gives the `label` which is the type of flower. Our goal is to use this data set to train our 
classifier, and then we can use that classifier to predict the species of a new given flower. We could have used 
many different classifiers like `neural nets` or `support vector machines` to solve this problem , but we are going to 
stick to the same `Decision Tree` classifier because they are easy to read and understand.

Let us get started with hands-on:

* First, let us create an empty python file. Let us name it `iris-flower.py`.
* Now, let us get done with the imports. `scikit-learn` has already provided lot of sample data sets and luckily 
iris data-set is one of them. Along with it, we will import some other utilities as well. Our program looks something like
this now:
 ````
  import numpy as np
  from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
  from sklearn import tree
 ```` 
 The first import would get the `numpy` library which is used for scientific computing. If you have installed `python`
 with `conda` correctly, `numpy` will be available already. In the second import, we are importing the iris flower data set.
 Third import is just importing tree as in the previous example.

* Now, we are ready to load the iris data set in a variable like this:
  ````
   iris = load_iris()
  ````
* Now, we would identify some rows in the data set, which we would use to predict the output later. For this example, we
  would get the `0th`, `50th` and `100th` row from the data set. If we look at the data set from the [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) 
  we can clearly identify that `0th`, `50th` and `100th` row corresponds to `setosa`, `versicolor` and `virginica` respectively.
  So basically, we have picked one flower of each type for our testing data.

* Now, we will remove the above mentioned rows from the data set. The code for it looks like this:
  ````
   training_data = np.delete(iris.data, test_index, axis=0)
   training_target = np.delete(iris.target, test_index)
  ````
  
  the variable `iris.data` contains the features (length, width etc) and `iris.target` contains the label value. Again,
  in this data set, 0,1 and 2 means `setosa`, `versicolor` and `virginica` flower. So essentially, we have removed those
  three entries from the data set. Now, our training data is ready.

* Now, let us prepare our testing data. This is the data, we would use to verify if our program is able to identify the 
  flower type with some level of accuracy or not. Below is the code for the same:
  ````
   testing_data = iris.data[test_index] # length etc - features
   testing_target = iris.target[test_index] # flower types - labels
  ````
  Again, `testing_data`  is the set of features, we would provide to the program, to get the output. Then, the output will be 
  matched against `testing_target` to see if it has predicted the output correctly.

* Now, we will initialize the classifier and feed the data set to it.
  ````
   clf = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier()
   clf = clf.fit(training_data, training_target)
  ````
  
* Now, let us provide the classifier with a sample input and check if it is able to predict the output correctly or not.
  ````
   print ("expected output is:  %s" %(testing_target))
   
   print ("actual output is:  %s" %(clf.predict(testing_data)))
  ````
* Our program is complete and this is how it looks like:
 ````
    import numpy as np
    from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
    from sklearn import tree
    
    iris = load_iris()
    test_index = [0,50,100]
    
    #training data created by picking 0, 50 and 100 entry. basically picking one flower for each type.
    training_data = np.delete(iris.data, test_index, axis=0) #holds features
    training_target = np.delete(iris.target, test_index)     # holds labels
    
    #testing data
    testing_data = iris.data[test_index] # length etc - features
    testing_target = iris.target[test_index] # flower types - labels
    
    clf = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier()
    clf = clf.fit(training_data, training_target)
    
    print ("expected output is:  %s" %(testing_target))
    
    print ("actual output is:  %s" %(clf.predict(testing_data)))
 ````

* Upon running the program, this is the output we get:
  ````
    expected output is:  [0 1 2]
    actual output is:  [0 1 2]
  ````
  
  This means, the it has predicted the first row of testing data as `setosa`, second as `versicolor` and third as 
  `virginica`, which is exactly what we expected.
  
This concludes our case study of iris flower data set using machine learning.
